# Where did I go?
It has been many months since my last update and honestly, I've been kind of lost with this project. I thought it would be relatively straightforward to spin up a server,
collect data, show data, and market, but I realize it requires a lot of commitment and resources. Starting my final year of University a few months ago in September,
I found myself really busy and couldn't focus on any big side projects with big time and logistical commitment.

# Roadmap?
Based on my many months of hiatus, I have come up with some kind of roadmap which I hope to eventually go through with and complete. 

## Original Roadmap Shown Below:

**Stage 1: Documentation**:
- Dev Blog
- Discord Server
- Instructions and READMEs

**Stage 2: Develop Useful Tools**
Create tools that will genuinely enhance the experiences of players

**Stage 3: Gather Data and Analyze**
Use the tools to give players insights and statistics on what their character is doing and their performance

# Thoughts on Roadmap
The original roadmap plan was 7 stages with the end-result being a full-fledged business at that point. However, based on time allocation, This will have to do.

The main focus on the platform has shifted to creating smaller scale tools and scripts and keep costs low. As I am, for the time being, a student, and the economy has been slow in 2023, this roadmap will be kept.

## Platform Mission Statement
I have tried my best to keep with the mission statement and honestly think that building a community of developers that enjoy data would be a bit more fun than running it like a business:

The goal of ELD is to provide data from any source available on the [Entropia Universe](entropiauniverse.com) MMO and is compliant with the EULA and ToS. In recent years, various game tools and websites have been established by players to provide helpful information to the game, so why not another!? Might as well!

## What's Next?
The Dev Blog will be merged into the ELD Updates of The Lost Datapad and kept as-is. There is no need for a new website, as the current roadmap only needs a blog and a directory for alternative community tools.

I'm more focused on developers and data analysts at the moment, so the tools I personally release will be most likely lacking any kind of User Interface. Basic setup instructions will be given for those with a technical background and I will see whether I want people to edit them or not.
