It’s been a while and 2023 is a start to a new year. To kick off the new year, I’ve decided to revamp the Entropia Land Data project and finally get it done. 

As the owner and maintainer of the project, most of the development is dependent on my scheduling with university and work. As a result, it seemed to have been delayed and neglected in the past. However, with a renewed enjoyment of the MMO game, I’ve decided to set myself a goal in 2023 to develop and grow it. 

Recently I’ve been working on a roadmap on the revamp and in general, the development steps I plan to do to get this project off the ground. 

# Platform Mission Statement
The goal of ELD is to provide data from any source available on the [Entropia Universe](entropiauniverse.com) MMO and is compliant with the EULA and ToS. In recent years, various game tools and websites have been established by players to provide helpful information to the game, so why not another!? Might as well!

# Dev Blog
This is the official dev blog for the project and the content on this blog will be:

- Version releases
- Roadmap updates
- Platform achievements
- Uptime Status
- Migrations and updates

I hope you stick around and enjoy the show as I attempt to revamp and revive this data project!
